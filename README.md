# Training_Sentiment_Model_using_BRET
My goal for this project was learn how to build and deploy a production-grade movies reviews sentiment model using BERT model serving it with Flask API. 
Users are able to send text to the model, via an API, and get back predictions on local server.
This uses Bert for detection
